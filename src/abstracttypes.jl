Measurement AbstractCFA. 
Building Block for Taxonomy. Multiple Measurements can be combined to a Taxon. 

## Arguments

- `n_sample`: Number of observed cases. May be between different taxons from same paper sometime, e.g. multigroup models.
- `n_variables`: Number of variables (possibly observed/manifest).
- `loadings`: Vector of loadings, one for each item. 
- `factor_variance`: Variance of the factor.
- `error_variances`: Vector of variances of the respective errors
- `error_covariances_within`: Vector of covariances within factor.
- `error_covariances_between`: Vector of covariances the factor shares with a different factor. 
- `crossloadings_incoming`: Vector of crossloadings coming from other factors. They should be lower than the loading coming to the item from this factor.  
- `crossloadings_outgoing`: Vector of crossloadings going to other items which have higher loadings from other factors. 

```jldoctest
Measurement(n_variables = 2, loadings = [1, 0.4], factor_variance = 0.6)

# output

Measurement
   n_sample: Judgement{Missing}
   n_variables: Judgement{Int64}
   loadings: Judgement{Vector{Float64}}

   error_covariances_between: Judgement{Int64}

   crossloadings_outgoing: Judgement{Int64}

Standalone Factor Taxon. 
Taxon for Models with only one factor.

## Arguments

- `nsample`: Sample size.

LatentPathmodel AbstractPathmodel. 
Consists of a graph from StenoGraphs structural (structural model) and a meassurement (measurement model). 

## Arguments

- `structural`: Graph from StenoGraphs package. Defines the latent relations between the factors of measurement.  
- `measurement`: Vector of Factors.

```julia
using StenoGraphs
using Taxonomy

factor1 = Measurement(n_variables = 2, loadings = [1, 0.4], factor_variance = 0.7)

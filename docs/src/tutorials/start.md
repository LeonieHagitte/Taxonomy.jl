The idea behind doing the coding in Julia is that we can automate two things.

1. We can enforce syntactical requirements with a quick feedback loop for the coder, resulting in less errors.
2. We can automatically infer much information, resulting in speedier and less error prone coding.

We implement these automation to detect error/misunderstanding/etc *while* coding and not long after.

To get a feeling for how this is supposed to work, we code the famous political democracy paper together:

```jldoctest first; output = false
using Taxonomy 
first_record = Record(location = DOI("10.2307/2095172"),
    taxons = [GFactor(nobserved = 6, nerror_covariances = 3)],
    spec = true,
    data = true
)

# output
